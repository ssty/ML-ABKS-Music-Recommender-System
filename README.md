### Algorithms
- PCA
- K-Means
- Pearson Correlation

### Filters
- Content Based Filtering:

    Content-based filtering uses similarities in products, services, or content features, as well as information accumulated about the user to make recommendations. 
    In our case we have created a recommendation system which recommends songs based on similar songs. Music Recommender based on different KMeans and PCA algorithm


- Collaborative

    Item to item based collaborative filtering:
    This method looks at the ratings of similar items and recommends items that are similar to the ones a user has liked. It is based on the idea that items that are similar to each other will be liked by similar users. 
    This method can be used to make recommendations for all users.
    

- Hybrid

    It is a recommendation system which is combination of the content and collaborative filtering method. 
    By using content and collaborative-based methods to generate predictions separately and then combining the prediction, we can generate more accurate recommendations and also reduces the problem of cold start.

### Issues Improved
- Cold Start
- Accuracy
